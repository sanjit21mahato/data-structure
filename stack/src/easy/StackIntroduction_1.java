/*	Stack is linera data structure which is based on First In Last Out or LIFO. 
	means the element which is inserted first can be removed at last
	Both insertion and deletion takes place at one end only.
	
	Stack is class in java.util package
	Stack is a class within the Collection framework that extends the Vector class in Java. 
	It also implements List, Collection, Iterable, Cloneable, and Serializable interfaces. 
	
	Stack Operations:
	Insertion is called push() 
	removal is called pop()
	view is peek()
	size() and isEmpty are the major operational methods of Stack.
	
	Stack can be implemented using Array, Linked List
	
	LIFO functionality in java can be achieved by Stack and ArrayDeque
	Stack is a class within the Collection framework that extends the Vector class in Java. 
	It also implements List, Collection, Iterable, Cloneable, and Serializable interfaces. 
	ArrayDeque is class which implements Deque and Deque extends Queue and Queue implements Collection 
	
	In single thread environment use ArrayDeque where needed LIFO functionality
	Becasue Stack is costly in single threaeded envirmnment and it extends Vector which is synchronized
