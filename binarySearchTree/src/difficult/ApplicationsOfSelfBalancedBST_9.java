/**
All operations in SelfBalanced BST are log(n)

1. To maintain sorted stream of data.
2. To implement double ended priority queue.
    Single ended priority queue is implemented using Heap data structure.
    Doubly ended priority queue is used when both most and least priority needs to be known
3. To solve problems like
     count smaller/greater in a stream
     Find Floor/ceiling/greater/smaller in a stream in log(n)
