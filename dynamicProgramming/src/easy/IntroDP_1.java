	 * DP is optimization of plain recursion. In recursion we use solution of sub problems and In DP we store 
	 * the solution of sub problem and use it when ever required instead of finding the solution again for the 
	 * same sub problem.   
	 *
	 *There are two ways to implement dynamic programming:
	 *Memoization also called top down
	 *Tabulation also called bottom up.
	 *
	 *Applications of DP:
	 *There are many real world implementation in computer science using DP.
	 *Bellman Ford Algorithm (to find shortest path from source to all the destinations , used in routing)
	 *Flyod Warshall Algorithm (to find shortest path between every pair of vertices in a graph)
	 *Diff Utility(something we use in day to day life, to kow differences between tow files VCS)
	 *Search Close Words(Edit distance , while searching we want to search close words of whta we have typed)
	 *Resource Allocation(0-1 kanpsack)
